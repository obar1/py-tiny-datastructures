## init
use make
ex
```bash
make setup
pre-commit install # optional
# each time new code is ready for PRs :P
make refactor
```

## intro
This repo is a `sandbox` inspired by 
https://www.udemy.com/course/data-structures-algorithms-python/
![alt text](b80fbdfb-c570-4323-a2ae-69ad009f07a0.png)
> plz support the author and buy the course 

and not less the classic: 
`Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs`, 1976 book written by Niklaus Wirth covering some of the fundamental topics of system engineering, computer programming, particularly that algorithms and data structures are inherently related.

### data structures 
here we can add notebooks for a few data structures:
- [Linked Lists](src/nb/linked-lists.ipynb)
- [Doubly Linked Lists](src/nb/doubly-linked-lists.ipynb)
- [Stacks & Queues](src/nb/stacks-queues.ipynb)
- [Trees](src/nb/trees.ipynb)
- [Hash Tables](src/nb/hash-tables.ipynb)
- [Graphs](src/nb/graphs.ipynb)
- [Heaps](src/nb/heaps.ipynb)
- [Recursive Binary Search Trees](src/nb/recursive-binary-search-trees.ipynb)
 
### experiments
- [Tree Traversal](nb-experiments/tree-traversal.ipynb)
- [Recursion](nb-experiments/recursion.ipynb)
> use duckdb to record perforances and comapare performance of the various data structures
to do some `basic` performances comparison
- [Has Performance Test 000](nb-experiments/has-performance-test-000.ipynb)

### TODO/WIP:
```
Basic Sorts
Merge Sort
Quick Sort
```
