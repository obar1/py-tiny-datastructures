## intro

This repo is a `sandbox` inspired by 

https://www.udemy.com/course/data-structures-algorithms-python/

![alt text](b80fbdfb-c570-4323-a2ae-69ad009f07a0.png)
and 

`Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs`, 1976 book written by Niklaus Wirth covering some of the fundamental topics of system engineering, computer programming, particularly that algorithms and data structures are inherently related.

## what `:wip:`

here we can add notebooks for a few data structures:

- [Node](node/readme.md) 
- [Linked Lists](linked-lists/linked-lists.ipynb)
- [Doubly Linked Lists](doubly-linked-lists/doubly-linked-lists.ipynb)
- [Stacks & Queues](stacks-queues/stacks-queues.ipynb)
- [Trees](trees/trees.ipynb)
- [Hash Tables](hash-tables/hash-tables.ipynb)
- [Graphs](graphs/graphs.ipynb)
- [Heaps](heaps/heaps.ipynb)
- [Recursion](recursion/recursion.ipynb)
- [Recursive Binary Search Trees](recursive-binary-search-trees/recursive-binary-search-trees.ipynb)
- [Tree Traversal](tree-traversal/tree-traversal.ipynb)
